# Tabular Data Augmentation

In this repository we share several techniques that have been used to augment the minority class of the following dataset

| Group | Number of Patients | Description                                  |
|-------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1     | 297                | No lesions at any time                       |
| 2     | 22                 | No lesions at baseline, lesions at follow-up |
