# Tabular Data Augmentation

In this repository, we share several techniques that have been used to augment the minority class of a medical dataset.
This dataset is part of a research project of Sant'Andrea Hospital about predicting Gastric Neoplastic Lesions in patients with Gastric Atrophy.


| Group | Number of Patients | Description                                  |
|-------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1     | 297                | No lesions at any time                       |
| 2     | 22                 | No lesions at baseline, lesions at follow-up |
